                                I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
